# Seattle-Weather
By Lukas Nitsche

In this project, we will explore the differences observed in the weather patterns in Seattle and New York. 

In the data analysis notebook, I took in data from a GitHub source and narrowed it down to the average precipitation by day across weather stations in Seattle and New York. Using both Vega Altair and Seaborn, I made plots to analyze the differences by month, by year, and total precipitation occurrences and rainfall totals for the two cities.
